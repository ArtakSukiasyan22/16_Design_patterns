# Design Patterns

This repository includes C++ implementations of various design patterns in software engineering. 
These patterns are categorized into three main types: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.

## Creational Patterns 
Creational design patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

- **Singleton**
- **Factory Method**
- **Abstract Factory**
- **Builder**
- **Prototype**

## Structural Patterns 
Structural design patterns deal with object composition, creating relationships between objects to form larger structures.

- **Adapter**
- **Bridge**
- **Composite**
- **Decorator**
- **Facade**
- **Flyweight**
- **Proxy**

## Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral design patterns deal with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

- **Chain of Responsibility**
- **Command**
- **Interpreter**
- **Iterator**
- **Mediator**
- **Memento**
- **Observer**
- **State**
- **Strategy**
- **Template Method**
- **Visitor**
